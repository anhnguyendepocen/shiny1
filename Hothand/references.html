<p><a href="nba3point.csv" target="_blank">This data set</a> accompanies the paper. It contains the results from the NBA Three-Point Contest for 2013-2017.  For each year, player, and round, the results of all the player's attempts in the round are recorded in sequence, with 1 indicating a made field goal (success) and 0 indicating a miss (failure).  (In most cases there are 25 attempts in a round.)  The results sequence for a particular player can be copied and pasted into the <strong>Enter observed results sequence</strong> box.</p>
<p>The hot hand analysis which the app performs is based on the methods in a series of papers by <a href="http://didattica.unibocconi.eu/mypage/index.php?IdUte=111643&amp;cognome=MILLER&amp;nome=JOSHUA%20BENJAMIN&amp;urlBackMy=">Joshua B.
